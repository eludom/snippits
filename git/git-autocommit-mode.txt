In Emacs, every file save can now be a git commit+push. Backups are
now irrelevant (at least for emacs git users).  And you thought VMS
file version numbers were pretty neat...

* Setup

  Install the package (=M-x package-install git-auto-commit-mode=) etc.

  Add to your favorite =init.el= or friend:

  #+begin_example
  (add-hook 'certain-hook 'git-auto-commit-mode)
  #+end_example

* Global Configuation

  Decide how daring and/or annoyed you want to be.  To go all-in and
  always ask for summary and push do the following:
  

  #+begin_example
  (setq gac-automatically-push-p t)
  (setq gac-ask-for-summary-p t)  
  #+end_example

* Per Directory configuration

  To do things on a directory level, put something like this

  #+begin_example
  ((nil . ((gac-ask-for-summary-p t)
  	   (eval git-auto-commit-mode t))))
  #+end_example

  in a file called =.dir-locals.el= in a directory you want to hae
  pushed.  See http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html

  You can also specify per file variables
  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables
  if you choose.
